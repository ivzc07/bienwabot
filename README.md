# bienwabot - `rebe-agent`

Rebe, the bien.mx WhatsApp news agent.
One Python process, one replica, two triggers (an Evolution webhook and a scheduled news leg) and one shared pacer.

The design lives in `docs/wayfinder/`; `deployment-architecture-spec.md` is the map.
This repo currently holds the skeleton - typed configuration, an injectable clock, the container, the test gate - the DeepSeek brain both legs call, and the shared pacer both legs send through.
The webhook leg and the news leg land in later tickets.

## Running it

Configuration is entirely environment variables, listed with their purpose in `.env.example`.
`rebe_agent/config.py` is the only place the process reads the environment; everything else takes a `Settings` object.
A missing or malformed variable stops the process at boot with a message naming the variable, rather than failing later in the middle of a send.

```sh
docker build -t rebe-agent .
docker run --rm --env-file .env rebe-agent --check-config   # validate and exit
docker run --rm --env-file .env rebe-agent                  # boot and stay up
```

`--check-config` validates the environment, logs the startup line, and exits - useful in CI and after changing Coolify variables.

`TZ` defaults to `America/Mexico_City`, which drives the quiet-hours window and the posting shape.
Time-dependent code reads a `Clock` (`rebe_agent/clock.py`) rather than calling `datetime.now()` inline, so tests can place the process at 03:00 without waiting for 03:00.

## The brain

`rebe_agent/brain.py` is the only place this process talks to DeepSeek.
Every call goes to `deepseek-v4-flash`, the current non-thinking chat model, with thinking mode explicitly disabled, a `max_tokens` cap, and a Pydantic model as the answer.
A response that fails validation is an error, never a half-parsed object.

```sh
docker run --rm --env-file .env rebe-agent --ask "di hola en una linea"
```

That prints a validated object and, like every other call, counts itself in the `rebe` database.

Each call's cache-hit, cache-miss and completion tokens are accumulated per day and per call type, which turns the estimates in `docs/wayfinder/token-budget-spec.md` into something checkable.
The same counter is the runaway-loop detector: past 600 calls in a day the maintainer is alerted and the bot keeps going, past 2,000 it stops calling DeepSeek until the next day while the process, the heartbeat and the scheduler stay alive.
There is no dollar cap, because the damage from a loop is a banned number rather than a bill.

## The pacer

`rebe_agent/pacer.py` is the only place this process sends a WhatsApp message.
Both legs share one instance, because the anti-ban ceilings have to span news posts and webhook replies together - two limiters, one per leg, would each stay politely under twelve a day and between them send twenty-four.

Before a message lands, Rebe appears to type.
A `composing` presence goes up, a pause scaled to the message length passes - about 30 ms a character, Gaussian-jittered, never below 1.5 s or above 5 s - and the presence is refreshed while it passes, because Baileys expires it after about ten seconds.
A first message into a quiet thread gets an extra beat first.

The pacer will also say no.
Four sends a minute, three an hour, twelve a day, counted across both legs; scheduled posts held between 23:00 and 08:00; consecutive posts 75-90 minutes apart; between 02:00 and 06:00 everything spaced four to six times further apart than by day; and never the same wording twice in a row.
Every jittered gap is read off the send it is measured against rather than drawn fresh, because a threshold redrawn on each attempt is one a caller can retry its way past - which would quietly turn "75 to 90 minutes" into a flat 75.
A refusal is a `SendRefusedError` carrying a reason and, where it is knowable, how long until the door opens - so a caller can tell "come back in forty minutes" from "Evolution is down", which is an `EvolutionError` instead.
Deciding between deferring a post and dropping it belongs to the cadence leg, not here.

Every send is written to the `rebe` database before it goes on the wire, so a restart cannot hand a crash loop a fresh allowance, and a transport failure cannot turn a retry into a burst.

```sh
docker run --rm --env-file .env rebe-agent --say "hola" --to 1203...@g.us --as reply
```

That is the real send path, not a shortcut around it: the group sees the typing indicator, the pause is drawn rather than fixed, and the envelope gets its say.
`--as post` is the default and obeys the overnight hold and the post-to-post gap; `--as reply` obeys neither, matching the reply policy.
A refusal exits 4 and a transport failure exits 5.

## Working on it

```sh
python -m venv .venv && .venv/bin/pip install -e ".[dev]"
ruff check . && ruff format --check .
mypy
pytest
```

The counters and the send log are asserted against a real Postgres, so those tests skip unless one is pointed at:

```sh
docker run --rm -d -p 5432:5432 -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=rebe --name rebe-pg postgres:16
REBE_TEST_DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:rebe@127.0.0.1:5432/postgres pytest
```

CI runs exactly these, plus a container build and boot, in the `test` job of `.github/workflows/tests.yml`.
That job is the merge gate - see `AGENTS.md`.
