# bienwabot - `rebe-agent`

Rebe, the bien.mx WhatsApp news agent.
One Python process, one replica, two triggers (an Evolution webhook and a scheduled news leg) and one shared pacer.

The design lives in `docs/wayfinder/`; `deployment-architecture-spec.md` is the map.
This repo currently holds the skeleton - typed configuration, an injectable clock, the container, the test gate - and the DeepSeek brain both legs call.
The webhook leg, the news leg and the pacer land in later tickets.

## Running it

Configuration is entirely environment variables, listed with their purpose in `.env.example`.
`rebe_agent/config.py` is the only place the process reads the environment; everything else takes a `Settings` object.
A missing or malformed variable stops the process at boot with a message naming the variable, rather than failing later in the middle of a send.

```sh
docker build -t rebe-agent .
docker run --rm --env-file .env rebe-agent --check-config   # validate and exit
docker run --rm --env-file .env rebe-agent                  # boot and stay up
```

`--check-config` validates the environment, logs the startup line, and exits - useful in CI and after changing Coolify variables.

`TZ` defaults to `America/Mexico_City`, which drives the quiet-hours window and the posting shape.
Time-dependent code reads a `Clock` (`rebe_agent/clock.py`) rather than calling `datetime.now()` inline, so tests can place the process at 03:00 without waiting for 03:00.

## The brain

`rebe_agent/brain.py` is the only place this process talks to DeepSeek.
Every call goes to `deepseek-v4-flash`, the current non-thinking chat model, with thinking mode explicitly disabled, a `max_tokens` cap, and a Pydantic model as the answer.
A response that fails validation is an error, never a half-parsed object.

```sh
docker run --rm --env-file .env rebe-agent --ask "di hola en una linea"
```

That prints a validated object and, like every other call, counts itself in the `rebe` database.

Each call's cache-hit, cache-miss and completion tokens are accumulated per day and per call type, which turns the estimates in `docs/wayfinder/token-budget-spec.md` into something checkable.
The same counter is the runaway-loop detector: past 600 calls in a day the maintainer is alerted and the bot keeps going, past 2,000 it stops calling DeepSeek until the next day while the process, the heartbeat and the scheduler stay alive.
There is no dollar cap, because the damage from a loop is a banned number rather than a bill.

## Working on it

```sh
python -m venv .venv && .venv/bin/pip install -e ".[dev]"
ruff check . && ruff format --check .
mypy
pytest
```

The counters are asserted against a real Postgres, so those tests skip unless one is pointed at:

```sh
docker run --rm -d -p 5432:5432 -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=rebe --name rebe-pg postgres:16
REBE_TEST_DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:rebe@127.0.0.1:5432/postgres pytest
```

CI runs exactly these, plus a container build and boot, in the `test` job of `.github/workflows/tests.yml`.
That job is the merge gate - see `AGENTS.md`.
