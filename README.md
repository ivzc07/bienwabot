# bienwabot - `rebe-agent`

Rebe, the bien.mx WhatsApp news agent.
One Python process, one replica, two triggers (an Evolution webhook and a scheduled news leg) and one shared pacer.

The design lives in `docs/wayfinder/`; `deployment-architecture-spec.md` is the map.
This repo currently holds the skeleton: typed configuration, an injectable clock, the container, and the test gate.
The webhook leg, the news leg and the pacer land in later tickets.

## Running it

Configuration is entirely environment variables, listed with their purpose in `.env.example`.
`rebe_agent/config.py` is the only place the process reads the environment; everything else takes a `Settings` object.
A missing or malformed variable stops the process at boot with a message naming the variable, rather than failing later in the middle of a send.

```sh
docker build -t rebe-agent .
docker run --rm --env-file .env rebe-agent --check-config   # validate and exit
docker run --rm --env-file .env rebe-agent                  # boot and stay up
```

`--check-config` validates the environment, logs the startup line, and exits - useful in CI and after changing Coolify variables.

`TZ` defaults to `America/Mexico_City`, which drives the quiet-hours window and the posting shape.
Time-dependent code reads a `Clock` (`rebe_agent/clock.py`) rather than calling `datetime.now()` inline, so tests can place the process at 03:00 without waiting for 03:00.

## Working on it

```sh
python -m venv .venv && .venv/bin/pip install -e ".[dev]"
ruff check . && ruff format --check .
mypy
pytest
```

CI runs exactly these, plus a container build and boot, in the `test` job of `.github/workflows/tests.yml`.
That job is the merge gate - see `AGENTS.md`.
